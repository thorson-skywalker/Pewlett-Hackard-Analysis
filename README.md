The data indicates there are several factors the hiring dempartment might want to consider going forward:

1. 90,398 employees fall within the eligible retirement range.
2. The vast majority of postitions that are could empty are senior postiions, 57,668 senior engineers and staff.
3. Only 2 managers are within the retirement range.
4. There are only 1,549 employees eligibile for mentorship programs

## Summary

Currently, Pewlette Hackard is looking to replace over 90,000 employees who are due to retirement. This is a huge number of positions tht needs to be filled. This issue is compounded by the fact that nearly 60,000 of the potential empty positions are senior positions. This will leave a significant skill deficit within the company. Normally, filling these postiions can be handled internatlly through training and preparing younger employees to take on these roles. However, there are only 1,549 employees currently eligible for mentorship. That is not nearly enough employees to bring into these positions. There will be a huge deficit in these postiions if these employees begin to retire as soon as they are able.

While the deficit may seem concerning, there is still some very important data that needs to be collected to know how quickly these positions will need to be filled. First, with the employment data that already exists, we can determine what the average age employees retire to give a better idea of when to expect when specific employees will retire. Not all employees will retire at the same age, and having a better idea of the trends of previous retirements will help guide the hiring department's goals going forward. Secondly, increasing the size of the mentorship group could also help significantly increase the number of positions that could be filled internally. This would also assist in determining what the hiring goals should be to replace the "silver tsunami".
